# STM32MP157A-EV1 BSP (Board Support Package) Instruction

The STM32MP157A-EV1 Evaluation boards are the full-feature demonstration and development platforms for STMicroelectronics Arm®-based dual Cortex®-A7 32 bits and Cortex®-M4 32 bits MPUs in the STM32MP1 Series. They leverage the capabilities of STM32MP1 Series microprocessors to allow users develop applications using STM32 MPU OpenSTLinux Distribution software for the main processor and STM32CubeMP1 software for the co-processor.

They include an ST-LINK embedded debug tool, LEDs, push-buttons, one joystick, 1-Gbps Ethernet, CAN FD, one USB OTG Micro-AB connector, four USB Host Type-A connectors, LCD display with touch panel, camera, stereo headset jack with analog microphone input, four digital microphones, one SPDIF Rx/Tx, smartcard, microSD™ card, and eMMC, NOR and NAND Flash memories.
To expand the functionality of the STM32MP157A-EV1 and STM32MP157C-EV1 Evaluation boards, two GPIO expansion connectors are also available for motor control and Raspberry Pi® shields.
